# Teapot Animation

HTML Structure:

Start by creating basic div elements representing different parts of the teapot, such as the body, spout, lid, and handle. Each of these div elements can be nested to group parts together.
CSS Styling:

Style each part of the teapot using CSS properties:
Body: A rounded shape like a circle or ellipse, using border-radius and a background color.
Spout: A small div rotated and positioned to appear as if itâ€™s pouring from the body.
Handle: A half-circle shape, typically created with border properties to look like a handle attached to the teapot body.
Lid: A smaller circle on top of the body to represent the teapot lid.
Steam Animation:

Create steam rising from the spout using additional small circles or ellipses animated with CSS. Set up @keyframes to move these steam shapes upward and fade out as they rise.
Use transform properties like translateY, opacity, and scale to make the steam look more realistic.
Animating the Teapot:

To add life to the teapot, a subtle animation can be applied to make it "tilt" as if pouring:
Use @keyframes for a rotation effect, applying it to the main teapot div.
Adjust transform-origin to make it tilt naturally around its base or bottom edge.
For a continuous effect, use animation-iteration-count: infinite; with a short animation-duration.
